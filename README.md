## Usage

Also you can set property shift, which will indicate whether breadcrumb should be hidden for 
mobile view(when viewport is smaller then 420px).
```
Breadcrumbs breadcrumbs = new Breadcrumbs();
breadcrumbs.add(
    new Breadcrumb("Home","breadcrumbs/#", true),
    new Breadcrumb("Components", "breadcrumbs/#", true),
    new Breadcrumb("VCF Components", "breadcrumbs/#"),
    new Breadcrumb("Breadcrumbs"));
```
